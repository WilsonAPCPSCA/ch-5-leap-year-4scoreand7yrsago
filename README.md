# ch5LeapYear

Write a method
	```javapublic static boolean isLeapYear(int year)```

that tests whether a year is a leap year: that is a year with 366 days. Leap years are necessary to keep the calendar synchronized with the sun because the earth revolves around the sun once every 365.25 days. That figure is not entirely precise, and for all dates after 1582 the Gregorian correction applies. Usually years that are divisible by 4 are leap years, for example 1996. However, years that are divisible by 100 (for example, 1900) are not leap years, but years that are divisible by 400 are leap years (for example, 2000). In this exercise, use multiple if statements and return statements to return the result as soon as you know it.
